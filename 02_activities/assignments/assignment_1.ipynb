    ". Initialize a Set: Start with an empty set to keep track of the values we have encountered as we traverse the tree.\n",
    ". DFS Traversal: Use a stack (or recurtion) to perform DFS on the tree. Start with the root node.\n",
    ". Check for Duplicates: As you visit each node, check if its value is already in the set. If it is, return that value immediately, as it is the first duplicate encountered. If it isn’t, add the value to the set.\n",
    ". Traverse Children: Continue the DFS traversal by pushing the left and right children of the current node onto the stack (or by calling the recursive function).\n",
    ". No Duplicates Found: If the traversal completes without finding any duplicates, return -1.\n",

    ". Initialize a Queue: Start with a queue that stores pairs of the current node and the path taken to reach that node.\n",
    ". BFS Traversal: Begin the traversal from the root node. The initial path will be just the root node’s value.\n",
    ". Process Nodes: For each node, do the following:. If the node is a leaf (i.e., it has no left or right children), add the path to the list of paths. If the node has a left child, add the left child and the updated path to the queue. If the node has a right child, add the right child and the updated path to the queue.\n",
    ". Collect Paths: Continue the BFS traversal until the queue is empty. By then, all paths from the root to the leaf nodes will have been collected.\n",
